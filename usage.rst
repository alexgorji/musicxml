1. Check the version of python on your computer: `python --version`. This library has been developed under ``python 3.9``. Possibly you
have to install this version (for example via Homebrew or whatever way you choose.)

2. Make a new folder and create a virtual environment for your project and install musicxml via pip:
    * mkdir <project>
    * cd <project>
    * python3 -m venv venv
    * source venv/bin/activate
    * pip install --upgrade pip

.. code-block:: console

    (.venv) $ pip install musicxml
